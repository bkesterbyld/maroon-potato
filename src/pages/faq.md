      - title: Are you a database company?
        content: >-
          **No.**

          Above is a service that runs above mature SQL, NoSQL and Object
          storage technologies across cloud providers. Above is an abstraction
          layer that brings physical distributed servers together with virtual
          data modeling and logic technology. We've been perfecting that
          technology for 10 years and it's been proven in a prior company that
          handled extreme enterprise-grade projects for Tesla, BAE Systems,
          Facebook, Microsoft, AWS and more. Because we use proven technologies,
          Above is safe, reliable and predictable. Also, since we don't have to
          develop a database, all of our time is focused on bringing you new
          features such as data warehousing (planned). 
      - title: How do I avoid lock-in?
        content: >-
          We run at many of the cloud providers and locations that you may
          already have infrastructure at. You can extract data from Above into
          your database of choice via the API. Within Above, you'll know where
          your data is stored in terms of cloud provider and locationâ€”so in many
          cases you do the transfer without incurring bandwidth egress charges
          from your provider. We anticipate adding robust data migration
          services via vendor partners as we grow. 
      - title: What are parallel and in-memory processing?
        content: >-
          Parallel and in-memory processing are two techniques to handle high
          load and intense computing situations. Parallel processing is
          important for manipulating large data sets and getting a performant
          response. The approach is to break data sets into pieces and use
          syncrhonous logic to achieve some CRUD result faster, or transform
          some data set into higher level analytics without waiting hours or a
          day. In-memory processing, on the other hand, is extremely useful for
          high throughput operations and calculations where either speed is
          essential or you are trying to do a simulataneous operation of many
          large, massive, disparate data sets. By putting data into memory, you
          can do calculations in nanosecond timeframes while  avoiding physical
          database contention, CPU racing and other nasty computer science
          problems. 
      - title: How does the logic work? Can I code my own?
        content: >-
          Above's no code logic is based in large part on [control-flow
          ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)principles. The approach
          is to assemble independent logic agents that operate across a global
          network of data sets. Agents are comprised of commands and actions
          similar to statements a backend developer you might normally hardcode.
          Agents can call each other to perform tasks and work in a group to
          accomplish objectives. They run in real-time based on events and data
          changes, or can operate on a timer. They can also be called from the
          API to execute their mission(s). When agents are combined with Above's
          data modeling  and processing options, you can move beyond CRUD and
          workflow to execute performant real-time analytics across massive
          datasets. While we obviously are big believers in the convenience and
          power of this approach, we do plan to support sandboxed execution of
          JS and other scripts/languages as we grow.
