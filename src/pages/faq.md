      - title: Are you a database company?
        content: >-
          No. Above is a service that runs above mature SQL, NoSQL and Object
          storage technologies across cloud providers. Above's underlying
          technology is an abstraction layer that brings physical storage
          together with a virtualized data modeling and logic. Because we use
          proven technologies, Above is safe, reliable and predictable. Also,
          since we don't have to develop a database, we stay focused on bringing
          you new features such as data warehousing (in our future). 
      - title: How do I avoid lock-in?
        content: >-
          We run at many of the cloud providers and locations that you may
          already be running traditional infrastructure at. You can extract data
          from Above into your database of choice via the API. Within Above,
          you'll know where your data is stored in terms of cloud provider and
          locationâ€”so in many cases you do the transfer without incurring
          bandwidth egress charges from your provider.
      - title: What are parallel and in-memory processing?
        content: >-
          Parallel and in-memory processing are two techniques to handle high
          load and intense computing situations. Parallel processing is
          important for manipulating large data sets and getting a performant
          response. The approach is to break data sets into pieces and use
          syncrhonous logic to achieve some CRUD result faster, or transform
          some data set into higher level analytics without waiting hours or a
          day. In-memory processing, on the other hand, is extremely useful for
          high throughput operations and calculations where either speed is
          essential or concurrency becomes a real problem. By putting data sets
          into memory, you can do calculations in nanosecond timeframes while
          aslo avoiding physical database contention, CPU racing and other nasty
          computer science problems. 
      - title: Cras tincidunt lobortis feugiat vivamus at augue eget arcu?
        content: >-

          Volutpat maecenas volutpat blandit aliquam. Sem integer vitae justo

      - title: Porta nibh venenatis cras sed felis eget velit aliquet?
        content: >-
          Facilisis gravida neque convallis a cras semper auctor neque vitae.
          Dictum varius duis at consectetur lorem donec massa. Porta non
