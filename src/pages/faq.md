      - title: Are you a database company?
        content: >-
          **No.**

          Above is a service that runs above mature SQL, NoSQL and Object
          storage technologies across cloud providers. It's an abstraction layer
          that brings physical distributed servers together with virtual data
          modeling and logic technology. The result is a global, resilient data
          processing network.


          We've been perfecting that technology for 10 years and it's been
          proven in a prior company that handled extreme enterprise-grade
          projects for Tesla, BAE Systems, Facebook, Microsoft, AWS and others. 


          Because we use proven technologies, Above is safe, reliable and
          predictable. Also, since we don't have to develop a database, all of
          our time is focused on bringing new features to our users. 
      - title: How do I avoid lock-in?
        content: >-
          We run at many of the cloud providers and locations that you may
          already have infrastructure at. You can extract data from Above into
          your database of choice via the API.


          Within Above, you'll know where your data is stored in terms of cloud
          provider and location—so in many cases there are no bandwidth egress
          charges from your provider. 


          We anticipate adding robust data migration services via vendor
          partners as we grow. 
      - title: What are parallel and in-memory processing?
        content: >-
          Parallel and in-memory processing are two techniques to handle high
          load and intense computing situations.


          Parallel processing is important for manipulating large data sets and
          getting a quick response. The approach is to break data sets into
          pieces and use synchronous logic to achieve some CRUD result faster,
          or transform some data set into higher level analytics without waiting
          hours or a day.


          In-memory processing, on the other hand, is extremely useful for high
          throughput operations and calculations—where speed is essential or you
          are trying to do a simulataneous operations on many large, massive,
          disparate data sets. By putting data into memory, you can do
          calculations in nanosecond timeframes while avoiding physical database
          read/write issues.


          With Above's approach, you can architect standard, edge, parallel and
          in-memory processing in the right ratios for your use case and budget.
      - title: How does the logic work? Can I code my own?
        content: >-
          Above's no code logic is based in large part on [control-flow
          ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)principles. However, our
          approach is to assemble independent logic agents that operate across a
          global network of data sets.


          Agents are comprised of commands and actions similar to statements a
          backend developer might normally hardcode. Agents can call each other
          to perform tasks and work in a group to accomplish objectives. They
          run in real-time based on events and data changes, or can operate on a
          timer to do periodic processing or assemble reports. They can also be
          called from the API to execute their mission(s). When agents are
          combined with Above's data modeling and processing options, developers
          can move beyond CRUD and workflow to execute performant real-time
          analytics across massive datasets.


          While we obviously are big believers in the convenience and power of
          this approach, we do plan to support sandboxed execution of JS and
          other scripts/languages as we grow.
