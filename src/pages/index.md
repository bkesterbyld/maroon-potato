          Above unifies data modeling, storage and manipulation into an easy
          experience accessible to anyone. You can store all kinds of data
          through a single interface without knowing anything about databases—
          it gets distributed across SQL, NoSQL and object stores behind the
          scenes. No code logic agents enable you to implement transformations,
          CRUD, real-time analytics and more.

          operations that prevents database and silo proliferation. Each data
          set managed in Above can power multiple views that feed multiple
          applications. Each view gets it's own granular API key down to the
          field level if needed.
