        subtitle: 'A headless, cost-efficient approach to modernizing your back office'
        content: >
          Keeping your back office in real-time sync with your frontend
          experiences and commerce platforms is a costly proposition as you add
          new digital channels, suppliers and distributors. It often involves
          new infrastructure, consultants and adding user seats to your ERP,
          CRM, WMS and vendor contracts. Above provides a no code, serverless
          workspace to ingest, mix and serve key data from your back office
          systems.


          It handles disparate data from anywhere in the world effortlessly, and
          avoids the concurrency and resource contention problems with custom
          DBs, coding and infrastructure.


          *   Build intelligent business processes with your own user interfaces


          *   Share live data via browser or API with any business team or third
          party


          *   Derive new insights from mixed real-time data and execute your
          unique, differentiating algorithms
