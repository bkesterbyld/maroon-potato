          Create a common, secure multiparty data environment that directly
          powers novel applications
        content: >
          Keeping your back office in real-time sync with your partners and
          stakeholdres is a costly proposition as you grow, add new digital
          channels, and streamline your businesss. It often involves new
          infrastructure, systems integration and adding user seats to your ERP,
          CRM, WMS and vendor contracts. Above provides a no code, serverless
          workspace to ingest, mix and serve key data from you and your
          partner's key systems.


          It handles disparate data from anywhere in the world regardless of
          location or size. And it avoids the concurrency and resource
          contention problems that occur when running real time data operations
          at scale across different systems and SQL, NoSQL and object stores.


          *   Build new workflows and applications with partners that give you a
          competitive edge


          *   Scale beyond your existing systems without infrastructure or new
          seat licenses


          *   Inject AI and data science into new business processes


          *   Prototype, hhip and iterate new solutions at light speed
