        subtitle: Without the hassle of database and application servers
        content: >-
          Above enables computing near users anywhere without deploying
          databases, app servers or writing code. Our network allows you to put
          a full or mini-backend anywhere in the world while Active Data
          Management technology syncs only field-level changes across regions,
          ensuring snappy solution-wide response. 


          Above couples this network with [powerful computing options](/faq) to
          assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. And because Above is no code, shipping new
          features out the door is both fast and easy.
