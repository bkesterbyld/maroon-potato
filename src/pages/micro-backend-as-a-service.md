      - title: Conceive and refine your products faster
        subtitle: >-
          Above provides a non-technical space for to build sophisticated,
          scalable data prototypes and APIs without coding
        content: >
          The project phase when your engineers spin up, program and connect
          databases is essentially a black box—you don't know what's happening
          and whether your requirements are being implemented correctly. Then
          once initial user feedback comes in, changes are slow and require high
          communications overhead.


          Above offers a no code cloud environment—as easy as a spreadsheet— for
          you to prototype data models and sophisticated logic for your ideas
          without coding. As you create data prototypes, developers
          automatically get an API, so they can get to work on the frontend
          immediately.


          *   Quickly assemble powerful enterprise-class backend prototypes
          without any technical skills


          *   Test and iterate constantly without DevOps and backend engineering
          delay


          *   Ingest data from existing sources with less complexity than
          traditional integrations


          *   Collaborate across the whole team around central browser data
          views and traceable logic
