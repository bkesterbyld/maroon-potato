        subtitle: Create new features fast and put storage and processing next to users
        content: >-
          Above enables computing next to users without deploying databases,
          writing centralized code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. A full or partial backend can be positioned
          wherever needed in the Above network. Active Data Management
          technology syncs only field-level changes across regions, ensuring
          snappy solution-wide response. The end result is an autonomous, global
          data processing network. 


          Above couples this network with powerful, advanced computing options
          to assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. Any data set can be put into memory to handle
          high loads or transactional throughput. Massive data sets can be
          broken down and paralell processed for faster CRUD operations or for
          rapid analytic or reporting jobs. Combining both approaches enables
          handling of ML, AI and other data science use cases. Because Above is
          no code, getting new and powerful features out the door is both fast
          and easy.

          Quickly setup real-time global inventory, customer and corporate data
          views for key stakeholders
        content: >-
          Need inventory, customer or other corporate data to get your feature
          or project done? With Above, you can create data models that mirror
          what's in your big iron, SaaS, ERP, WMS, POS, CRM and other systems.
          These master data sets can be populated through connectors,
          integration services or by pushing the data into Above's API. Then you
          can build data normalization, cleansing and transformation logic as
          needed, without coding. 


          Once in Above's environment, you can create new aggregations and views
          of that data, run analytics and syndicate synchronized copies out to
          other teammates, colleagues and partner. You set the logic and rules
          for how data gets updated and synced, all without coding.
          Businesspeople can login to view data in a read-only modeâ€”speedping up
          requirements lock and the project timeline.
