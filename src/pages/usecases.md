        subtitle: Create new features fast and process data near users
        content: >-
          Above enables computing near users anywhere without deploying
          databases, writing code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. Our network allows you to put a full or partial
          backend anywhere in the world. Active Data Management technology syncs
          only field-level changes across regions, ensuring snappy solution-wide
          response. 


          Above couples this network with [powerful computing options](/faq) to
          assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. And because Above is no code, shipping new
          features out the door is both fast and easy.

        subtitle: >-
          Get ERP, marketing and other data in one reusable place to power
          innovation
        content: >+
          Standing up one-off databases for new projects and applications
          proliferates silos and increases maintenance costs. Above provides a
          Digital Operations Environment to mirror key data from  big iron,
          SaaS, ERP, WMS, POS, CRM and other systems. Data can be populated
          through connectors or through the API. Above's native logic tools can
          be used for automated cleansing and transformation.


          Once in this collaborative environment, data can be analyzed in
          real-time and workflow can be easily built across different data
          setsâ€”enabling innnovative new capabilities such as:


          * Real-time customer and marketing profiles 

          * Virtual shopping experiences

          * Personal shoppers / buyers

          * Service appointment scheduling

          * Global inventory views

          * Delivery tracking

          * Configure / Price / Quote for custom products

          * Predicting availability of out-of-stock products
