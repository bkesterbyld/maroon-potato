      - title: 'Fast, Distributed Micro-Backends'
        subtitle: Create new features fast and process data near users
        content: >-
          Above enables computing near users anywhere without deploying
          databases, writing code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. Our network allows you to put a full or mini-
          backend anywhere in the world while Active Data Management technology
          syncs only field-level changes across regions, ensuring snappy
          solution-wide response. 


          Above couples this network with [powerful computing options](/faq) to
          assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. And because Above is no code, shipping new
          features out the door is both fast and easy.

      - title: Digital Operations API
        subtitle: >-
          Get key ERP, marketing and other data in one reusable place to power
          innovation
        content: >-
          Standing up one-off databases for new projects fragments data and
          increases maintenance costs. Above provides a digital operations
          environment to mirror key data from big iron, ERP, SaaS, WMS, POS, CRM
          and other systems—and allow anyone to develop and collaborate around
          it.  


          Once in this environment, real-time analytics and workflow can be
          quickly assembled across different data sets—enabling automated
          decisions and novel digital experiences such as:


          * Real-time customer profiling and targeting

          * Dynamic pricing

          * Virtual shopping experiences

          * Subscription servicing

          * Personal shoppers / buyers

          * Curbside pickup

          * Service appointment scheduling

          * Automated replenishment 

          * Real-time global inventory

          * Warranty renewal, upsell and self-service

          * Consigned and vendor managed inventory

          * Delivery and supply chain coordination

          * Configure / price / quote for custom products

          * Predicting availability of out-of-stock products
