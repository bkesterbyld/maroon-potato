        subtitle: Create new features fast and put storage and processing near users

          Above enables computing next to users without deploying databases,
          writing centralized code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. Our network allows you to put a full or partial
          backend anywhere in the world. Active Data Management technology syncs
          only field-level changes across regions, ensuring snappy solution-wide
          response. 


          Above couples this network with powerful, advanced computing options
          to assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. Any data set can be put into memory to handle
          transactional or calculations throughput. Massive data sets can be
          broken down and paralell processed for faster CRUD operations or for
          faster analytic or reporting jobs. Combining both approaches enables
          handling of ML, AI and other data science use cases. Because Above is
          no code, shipping new, powerful features out the door is both fast and
          easy.

        subtitle: 'Get you ERP, marketing and other data in one place'

          Standing up one-off databases for new projects and applications
          proliferates silos and increases maintenance and downstream analytic
          costs. With Above, it's possible to rapidly create data models that
          mirror what's in your big iron, SaaS, ERP, WMS, POS, CRM and other
          systems. These master data sets can be populated through connectors,
          integration services or by pushing the data into Above's API. Then the
          native logic tools can be used for normalization, cleansing and
          transformation as needed, without coding. 


          Once in Above's environment, data sets can be by colleagues and
          partners through either direct access, or by giving them a synced
          copy. Data owners set the logic and rules for how data gets updated
          and synced, all without coding. Businesspeople can login to view data
          in a read-only mode—speedping up requirements lock and project
          timelines. And since the data is in a single, flexible environment it
          can power multiple future applications and enable data-driven
          operations
