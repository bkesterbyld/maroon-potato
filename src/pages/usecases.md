        subtitle: Create new features fast and put a full backend close to users
        content: >+
          Above helps you get data **and** processing next to your users without
          deploying databases, writing centralized code or calling cloud
          functions that have performance limits. You can deploy full backend
          functionality next to your users, while keeping copies synced globally
          without massive data transfers. Above does this with Active Data
          Management technology that detects field-level changes in data sets,
          replicating only the changes. Because the service is no code, it
          enables you to create an autonomous global processing network that is
          extremley easy to maintain and extend.


          Above couples this global processing with powerful, advanced computing
          options to assure high levels of performance to local users. You can
          put any data set into memory to handle high loads or high
          transactional throughput. You can break massive data sets down to
          execute parallel processing for either load management or to run
          intense real-time calculations, AI or ML. In many extreme use cases,
          Above is a more powerful toolset to manage, shape and serve data than
          any custom backend. Best of all, it doesn't ask you to learn anything.

          Create real-time, global inventory and customer and corporate data
          views accessible to key stakeholders
        content: >-
          Need inventory, customer or other corporate data to get your project
          done? With Above, you can create master data models that mirror what's
          in your big iron, SaaS, ERP, WMS, POS, CRM and other systems. These
          master data sets can then be populated through connectors, integration
          services or by pushing the data from those systems' tools into Above's
          API. Then you can build data normalization, cleansing and
          transformation logic as needed, without coding. 


          Once in Above's environment, you can create new aggregations and views
          of that data, run analytics and syndicate synchronized copies out to
          other teammates, colleagues and partner. You set the logic and rules
          for how data gets updated and synced, all without coding. And
          businesspeople can login to view data, or subsets of data in a
          read-only modeâ€”greatly helping with requirements collaboration and
          project efficiency.
