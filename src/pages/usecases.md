        subtitle: Create new features fast and process data near users
        content: >-
          Above enables computing near users anywhere without deploying
          databases, writing code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. Our network allows you to put a full or mini-
          backend anywhere in the world while Active Data Management technology
          syncs only field-level changes across regions, ensuring snappy
          solution-wide response. 


          Above couples this network with [powerful computing options](/faq) to
          assure high levels of performance to local users regardless of data
          types, speeds and sizes. And because Above is no code, shipping new
          features out the door is both fast and easy.
