        subtitle: Create new features fast and put data and processing at the last mile
        content: >-
          Above enables computing next to users without deploying databases,
          writing centralized code or calling cloud functions that have
          performance limits. Our network allows you to put a full or partial
          backend anywhere in the world. Active Data Management technology syncs
          only field-level changes across regions, ensuring snappy solution-wide
          response. 


          Above couples this network with powerful computing options to assure
          high levels of performance to local users regardless of data types,
          speeds and sizes. Any data set can be put into memory to handle high
          transactional or calculations throughput. Massive data sets can be
          broken down and paralell processed for faster CRUD operations or for
          faster analytic or reporting jobs. Combining both approaches enables
          handling of ML, AI and other data science use cases. Because Above is
          no code, shipping new, powerful features out the door is both fast and
          easy.

          Get you ERP, marketing and other data in one place to power new
          features and solutions

          Standing up one-off databases for new projects and applications
          proliferates silos and increases maintenance and downstream analytic
          costs. With Above, it's possible to rapidly mirror what's in your big
          iron, SaaS, ERP, WMS, POS, CRM and other systems. These master data
          sets can be populated through connectors or through Above's API. Then
          the native logic tools can be used for normalization, cleansing and
          transformation as needed, without coding. 


          Once in Above's environment, data sets can be shared with colleagues
          and partners through direct access or by giving them a synced copy in
          any region. Data owners set the logic and rules for how data gets
          updated and synced. Businesspeople can login to view data in a
          read-only modeâ€”speeding up requirements lock and project timelines.
          And since the data is in a single, flexible environment it can power
          multiple future applications.
