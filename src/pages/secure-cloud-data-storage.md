        subtitle: Create a DMZ between your data and consumers that need access to it
        content: >
          Use Above as a secure intermediary storage layer and DMZ to syndicate
          data across business units, agencies, systems integrators,
          distributors, vendors and other trading partnersâ€”without exposing
          backend data stores to unknown developers and database credentials to
          integration tools. 


          Above provides a variety of tools to replicate data sets, reshape them
          for specific data consumers 


          *   Push data into Above via our inbound API and data mapping tools


          *   Join and reshape data into purpose-built views for any party


          *   Choose where data should reside from across our multi-cloud
          network of locations


          *   Set field level API access if needed


          *   Issue time-based or temporary API keys
