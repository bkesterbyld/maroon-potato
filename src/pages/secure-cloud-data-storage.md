        content: >
          Above acts as a secure intermediary storage and processing zone to
          syndicate and exchange data across business units, agencies, systems
          integrators, distributors, vendors and other trading partnersâ€”without
          exposing your existing backend or DB credentials to any person or
          system.


          You get a variety of tools to replicate data sets and reshape them for
          specific data consumers:


          *   Push data into Above via our inbound API and data mapping tools


          *   Join and reshape data into purpose-built views for any party


          *   Choose where data should reside from across our multi-cloud
          network of locations


          *   Get granular control with optional field-level and time-based API
          keys


          *   Business users can login and view data sets and reports


          *   Partners can manipulate intermediate data via logic agents in the
          API

          party. Security can be controlled down to the field level and you can
          set dates and time windows for when the key is active.
